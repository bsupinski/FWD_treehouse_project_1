        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I graduated with a degree in multimiedia and had no road map or direction of what to do with it. The jobs I was being offered and eventually took were offering very minimal pay with no other benefeits and were not offering really any experience or ways to grow. I lost interest in the profession and searched for other jobs. After some casual learning with web develeopment I think I finally found my passion</p>
        <p>I've worked in customer service, worked in restaurants, and prodction planning.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to get a grasp on how the structure works so I can build off it an understand how to learn more and more about web development.</p>

          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would like to get a job anywhere where I can expand my skills and have people around I can learn from, while proving myself as a developer.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
