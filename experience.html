        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I graduated highschool in 2004. I took a few classes after at CCRI but never found a passion or subject I liked. In 2012 I started my associates degree in multimedia at New England Institute of Technology. I was taught various programs such as Phtotshop, Illustrator, Indesign, Flash Aftter effects, and Lightwave. Also learned concecpts about color pallets, video editing and creating a business image. In 2020 I started self teaching with online resources for Front End Web Development. </p>

        <h2>Job History</h2>
        <p>I had my first job in 2003 as a busboy at Evelyn's Villa. In 2005 I moved to a new restaurant, Cafee Romonzo. I worked there as a bus boy and party server.</p>
        <p>2007 I took a job at a UPS Store. I had a vast amount of job duties such as, cashing out customers, creating shipping lables, office supply request for customers(printing, faxing, laminating...etc), loading boxes from the store to a UPS truck, and opening and closing the store.</p>
        <p>2012 I worked at Trans Tex a printing company. My duties were to take customer art work and color correct it so their requested color would print with our inks. I would also fix art to repeat equally.</p>
        <p>Around 2014 I started AT IGT. At first I was just doing stress test on lotterly machines. I was brought back for a QA job where I would, test various code and designs on hardware and software. Would also creat reports on issues I found for software engineers.</p>
